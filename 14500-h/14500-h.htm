seruyce, but my selfe also. And in accõplysshynge
of his most honest request (partly by cause I

shuld wor<span class = "pagenum">4</span>thely be imputed to me,
&amp; that I might in this thynge also (accordynge to my
bounden dutie) gratifie my frende) I haue hassard
my selfe in these daungerous dayes, where many
are so capcyous, some prone and redy to malygne &amp;
depraue, and fewe whose eares are not so
festidious, tendre, and redy to please, that in
very tryfles &amp; thynges of small importaunce, yet
exacte dylygence and exquisite iudgement is loked

all other most necessary and requisite, that is to
saye, to rendre the sence &amp; the very meanyng of
the author, not so relygyouslie addicte to
translate worde for worde, for so the sence of the
author is oftentimes corrupted &amp; depraued, and
neyther the grace of the one tonge nor yet of the

lerned knoweth y<sup>t</sup> euery tonge hathe his peculyer

symple doinge to be thankefully taken, and in good

bestowed upon it.<br>

teache vs this same lesson, that we shuld not

secretly hyd, eue so a polled heed, a crispe or a
twyrled berde, a frowninge, a ferse, or a dogged

fables of Aesope, an asse maye lye secretely
unknowen by cause he is in a lyons skynne.<br>
<b>Poliphe.</b> Naye I knowe hym whiche bereth a shepe
vpon his heed, and a <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads 'fore'">sore</ins> in his brest, to whome I
wold wysshe with al my hart that he had as whyte
and as fauorable frendes as he hathe blacke eyes.

whiche bearest a hoole shepe and an ostryche to

<b>Poliphemus.</b>
There ye nypped &amp; taunted me in dede.<br>
<b>Cannius.</b> But
I wolde saye this geere dyd wonderous wel yf this
gospel boke dyd so adourne the with vertue as thou
hast adourned lymmed, and gorgiously garnysshed it
with many gay goodly glystryng ornamentes. Mary
syr thou hast set it forth in his ryght colours in
dede, wolde to god it might so adourne the with
good cõdiciõs that thou myghtest ones lerne to be
an honest man.<br>
<b>Poli.</b> There shall be no defaute in
me, I tell you I wyll do my diligence.<br>
<b>Can.</b> Naye
there is no doute of that, there shall be no more
faute in you now I dare say then was wonte to be.<br>
<b>Poli.</b> Yea but (youre tarte tauntes, and youre
churlysshe checkes, and raylynges set asyde) tell
me I pray the this one thynge, do you thus
disprayse, condempne, or fynde faute with them
whiche caryeth aboute with them the newe testament
or the gospel boke?<br>
<b>Canni.</b> No by my fayth do I not
good <span class = "pagenum">12</span>praty man.<br>
<b>Poliphe.</b> Call ye me but a
praty one and I am hygher then you by y<sup>e</sup> length
of a good asses heed.<br>
<b>Can.</b> I thynke not fully so
moche yf the asse stretch forth his eares, but go
to it skyllis no matter of that, let it passe, he
that bare Christ vpon his backe was called
Christofer, and thou whiche bearest the gospell
boke aboute with the shall for Poliphemus be
called the gospeller or the gospell bearer.<br>
<b>Polip.</b>
Do not you counte it an holy thynge to cary aboute
with a man the newe testament?<br>
<b>Cãni.</b> why no syr by
my trouth do I not, except thou graunte the very
asses to be holy to.<br>
<b>Poli.</b> How can an asse be
holy?<br>
<b>Cannius.</b> For one asse alone is able to beare
thre hundreth suche bokes, and I thynke suche a
great lubber as thou art were stronge inoughe to
beare as great a burden, and yf thou had a hansome
packesadle sette vpon thy backe.<br>
<b>Poliphe.</b> And yet
for all your iestynge it is not agaynst good
reason to saye <span class = "pagenum">13</span>that ye asse was holy which
bore christ.<br>
<b>Cannius.</b> I do not enuye you man for
this holynes for I had as lefe you had that
holynes as I, and yf it please you to take it I
wyll geue you an holy &amp; a religious relyke of the
selfe same asse whiche christ rode vpon, and whan
ye haue it ye may kysse it lycke it and cull it as
ofte as ye lyst.<br>
<b>Poli.</b> Mary syr I thanke you, ye
can not gyue me a more thanckefull gyfte nor do me
a greatter pleasure, for that asse withouten any
tayle was made as holye as any asse could be by
the touchynge of christes body.<br>
<b>Canni<sup>9</sup>.</b> Undouted
they touched christes body also whiche stroke and
buffeted christ.<br>
<b>Poliphe.</b> yea but tell me this one
thynge I praye the in good ernest. Is it not a
great sygne of holynes in a man to cary aboute the
gospel boke or the newe testament?<br>
<b>Cannius.</b> It is
a token of holynes in dede if it be done without
hypocrysie, I meane if it be done without
dissimulacion/and for <span class = "pagenum">14</span>that end, intent &amp;
purpose, that it shuld be done for.<br>
<b>Poliphe.</b> What
the deuyl &amp; a morten tellest thou a man of warre
of hypocrisie, away with hypocrisie to the monkes
and the freers.<br>
<b>Cannius.</b> Yea but bycause ye saye
so, tell me fyrste I praye you what ye call
hypocrisie.<br>
<b>Po.</b> When a man pretendis another thyng
outwardly then he meanis secretly in his mynde.<br>
<b>Cannius.</b> But what dothe the bearynge aboute of the
newe testament sygnyfie. Dothe it not betoken that
thy lyfe shulde be conformable to the gospell
which thou carryest aboute with the.<br>
<b>Poli.</b> I
thynke well it dothe.<br>
<b>Canni<sup>9</sup>.</b> Wel then when thy
lyfe is not conformable to the boke, is not that
playne hypocrisie.<br>
<b>Poliph.</b> Tell me thê what you
call the trewe carienge of the gospell boke aboute
with a man.<br>
<b>Cãni.</b> Sõme men beare it aboute with
them in theyr hãdes (as the gray freers were wonte
to beare the rule of saynt Fraunces) and so the
porters of Londõ, Asses <span class = "pagenum">15</span>&amp; horses may beare
it as well as they. And there be some other that
carry the gospel in theyr mouthes onlie, and such
haue no other talke but al of christ and his
gospell, and that is a very poynt of a pharysey.
And some other carrye it in theyr myndes. But in
myne opynion he beares the gospell boke as he
shuld do whiche bothe beares it in his hande,
cõmunes of it with his mouth whan occasyon of
edyfyenge of his neyghboure whan conuenyent
oportunytie is mynystred to him, and also beares
it in his mynde and thynkes vpon it withe his
harte.<br>
<b>Poli.</b> Yea thou art a mery felow, where
shall a man fynde suche blacke swãnes?<br>
<b>Cannius.</b> In
euery cathedrall church, where there be any
deacons, for they beare the gospel boke î theyr
hãde, they synge the gospell aloude, somtyme in a
lofte that the people may heare thê, althoughe
they do not vnderstand it, and theyr myndes are
vpõ it when they synge it.<br>
<b>Polphe.</b> And yet for all
your <span class = "pagenum">16</span>sayenge all suche deacons are no
saynttes that beare the gospell so in theyr
myndes.<br>
<b>Cannius.</b> But lest ye play the subtyle and
capcious sophystryar with me I wyll tell you this
one thynge before. No man can beare the gospell in
his mynde but he must nedes loue it from the
bothum of his harte, no man loueth it inwardly and
from the bothû of his harte but he must nedes
declare and expresse the gospell in his lyuinge,
outwarde maners, &amp; behauour.<br>
<b>Poli.</b> I can not skyll
of youre subtyle reasonynges, ye are to fyne for
me.<br>
<b>Can.</b> Thê I wyll commune with you after a
grosser maner, and more playnly. yf thou dyddest
beare a tankard of good Reynyshe wyne vpon thy
shulders onelye, what other thynge were it to the
then a burden.<br>
<b>Poliphe.</b> It were none other thynge
truly, it is no great pleasure so beare wyne.<br>
<b>Canni<sup>9</sup>.</b> What and yf thou dranke asmoche as thou
coudest well holde in thy mouthe, after the manner
of <span class = "pagenum">17</span>a gargarisme &amp; spyt it out agayne.<br>
<b>Po.</b>
That wolde do me no good at all, but take me not
with suche a faute I trow, for the wyne is very
bad and if I do so.<br>
<b>Canni.</b> But what and yf thou
drynke thy skynne full as thou art wont to do, whê
thou comest where good wyne is.<br>
<b>Poliphe.</b> Mary
there is nothyng more godly or heuynly.<br>
<b>Canni<sup>9</sup>.</b>It warmes you at the stomacke, it settes your body
in a heate, it makes you loke with a ruddy face,
and setteth your hart vpon a mery pynne.<br>
<b>Poliphe.</b>
That is suerly so as ye saye in dede.<br>
<b>Canni.</b> The
gospell is suche a lyke thynge of all this worlde,
for after that it hathe ones persed &amp; entered in
the veynes of the mynd it altereth, transposeth,
and cleane changeth vpsodowne the whole state of
mã, and chaungeth hym cleane as it were into a
nother man.<br>
<b>Polip.</b> Ah ha, nowe I wot wherabout ye
be, belyke ye thîke that I lyue not accordynge to
the gospell or as a good gospeller shulde do.<br>
<span class = "pagenum">18</span><b>Canni<sup>9</sup>.</b> There is no man can dyssolue this
questiõ better then thy selfe.<br>
<b>Poli.</b> Call ye it
dissoluynge? Naye and yf a thynge come to
dyssoluynge gyue me a good sharpe axe in my hande
and I trow I shall dyssolue it well inoughe.<br>
<b>Canni.</b> What woldest thou do, I praye the, and yf a
man shulde say to thy teth thou lyest falsely, or
elles call the by thy ryght name knaue in
englysshe.<br>
<b>Poli.</b> What wolde I do quod he, that is
a question in dede, mary he shulde feele the
wayghte of a payre of churlyshe fystes I warrant
the.<br>
<b>Canni.</b> And what and yf a man gaue you a good
cuffe vpon the eare that shulde waye a pounde?<br>
<b>Poliphe.</b> It were a well geuen blowe that wolde
aduauntage hym. xx. by my trouthe and he escaped
so he myght say he rose vpon his ryght syde, but
it were maruayle &amp; I cut not of his head harde by
his shulders.<br>
<b>Canni.</b> Yea but good felowe thy
gospell boke teacheth the to geue gentle answers,
and fayre wordes <span class = "pagenum">19</span>agayne for fowle, and to
hym that geueth the a blowe vpon the ryght cheke
to holde forth the lyfte.<br>
<b>Poliphe.</b> I do remembre I
haue red suche a thinge in my boke, but ye must
pardone me for I had quyte forgotten it.<br>
<b>Can.</b> Well
go to, what saye ye to prayer I suppose ye praye
very ofte.<br>
<b>Poli.</b> That is euyn as very a touche of
a pharesey as any can be.<br>
<b>Cannius.</b> I graunt it is
no lesse thê a poynte of a pharesey to praye longe
and faynedly vnder a colour or pretêce of holynes,
that is to saye when a man prayeth not frõ the
bothum of his hart but with the lyppes only and
from the tethe outward, and that in opyn places
where great resort of people is, bycause they wold
be sene. But thy gospel boke teacheth the to praye
contynually, but so that thy prayer come from the
bothu of the hart.<br>
<b>Poli.</b> Yea but yet for all my
sayenge I praye sumtyme.<br>
<b>Can.</b> When I beseche the
when y<sup>e</sup> art a slepe?<br>
<b>Poli.</b> When it cometh in to
my mynde, ones <span class = "pagenum">20</span>or twyse may chaunce in a
weke.<br>
<b>Can.</b> what prayer sayst thou?<br>
<b>Poliphe.</b> The
lordes prayer, the Pater noster.<br>
<b>Canni.</b> Howe many
tymes ouer?<br>
<b>Poli.</b> Onis, &amp; I trowe it is often
inoughe, for the gospell forbyddeth often
repetynge of one thynge.<br>
<b>Canni.</b> Can ye saye
your pater noster through to an ende &amp; haue youre
mynde runnynge vpon nothynge elles in all that
whyle?<br>
<b>Poli.</b> By my trouthe and ye wyll beleue me I
neuer yet assayed nor proued whether I coulde do
it or no. But is it not sufficient to saye it with
my mouthe?<br>
<b>Can.</b> I can not tell whether it be or
no. But I am sure god here vs not excepte we praye
from the bothum of our harte. But tell me another
thyng I wyll aske the. Doest thou not fast very
often?<br>

<b>Poliphemus.</b> I
wyll tell you that by &amp; by, and I dare saye you
wyl confesse no lesse your selfe then that I am an
ernest fauorer of the worde then I haue told you
y<sup>e</sup> tale. There was a certayne gray frere of the
order of saynt Fraunces w<sup>t</sup> vs whiche neuer
ceased to bable and rayle agaynste the newe
testament of Erasmus, I chaunsed to talke with the
gêtylman pryuatly where no man was present but he
and I, and after I had communed awhyle with hym I
caught my frere by the polled pate with my left
hande and with my right hãde I drew out my daggar
and I pomelled the knaue frere welfauardly aboute
his skonce that I made his face as swollen and as
puffed as a puddynge.<br>
<b>Canni<sup>9</sup>.</b> what a tale is
this that thou tellest me.<br>
<b>Poliphemus.</b> How say you
is not this a good and a sufficient proue that I
fa<span class = "pagenum">24</span>uer the gospell. I gaue hym absolucion
afore he departed out of my handes w<sup>t</sup> this newe
testament thryse layde vpon his pate as harde as I
myght dryue y<sup>t</sup> I made thre bunches in his heed
as bygge as thre egges in the name of the father,
the sone, &amp; the holy goost.<br>
<b>Can.</b> Now by my trouth
this was well done &amp; lyke a ryght gospeller of
these dayes. Truly this is as they saye to
dyffende the gospell with the gospell.<br>
<b>Poliphe.</b> I
met another graye frere of the same curryshe
couent, that knaue neuer had done in raylynge
agaynst Erasmus, so sone as I had espyed hym I was
styrred and moued with the brenninge zele of the
gospell that in thretenyng of him I made hym knele
downe vpon his knees and crye Erasmus mercie and
desyred me to forgyue hym, I may saye to you it
was hyghe tyme for hym to fall downe vpon his
marybones, and yf he had not done it by and by I
had my hal<span class = "pagenum">25</span>barde vp redy to haue gyuen hym
betwyxt the necke and the heade, I loked as grymme
as modie Mars when he is in furyous fume, it is
trewe that I tell you, for there was inoughe sawe
the frere and me yf I wolde make a lye.<br>
<b>Canni<sup>9</sup>.</b> I
maruayle the frere was not out of his wyt. But to
retourne to oure purpose agayne, dost thou lyue

not but that it is so as ye saye, but ye knowe
well that god is omnipotent and can do al thynges,

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net
